# Login/Register
Have added functionality for registering, logging in, and logging out. To register, simply click the link and fill out the form with username, first name, last name, email, password, and password confirmation. Thereafter, log in with username and password and the page will rememeber the user currently logged in, until they click Log out.

# Journal
The user can have a journal, wherein by submitting a form the entry gets added as a link to a page. This page displays the entry and allows the user to either update the entry or delete it entirely. Feel free to start the habit of keeping a journal and reflecting on each day's activities.

# Goals
Now, the user can also set daily, weekly, monthly, and long-term goals. They can then complete these goals, whereafter they will be saved in the 'Completed Goals' section. They also have the option to delete the goals entirely.

# Projects
The user can add any projects on which they are working, including the project title, goal time to finish the project, project status, description of the project, and
any other relevant information they desire. They can then update the project's information. They can also add project logs, whereby they record the progress they have
been making on their project. Finally, they can also delete the project entirely.
